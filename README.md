Project Title and Short Description
East Africa COVID-19 Data Analysis  
This project analyzes COVID-19 data for East African countries using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights on cases, deaths, and vaccination trends.

Objectives of the Project
• Clean and preprocess COVID-19 data for East African countries.
• Visualize trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
• Explore correlations between key COVID-19 indicators.
• Provide insights into the pandemic’s impact in the region.

List of Tools and Libraries Used
• Python (main programming language)
• pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
• matplotlib (data visualization)
• seaborn (statistical data visualization)
• Jupyter Notebook (interactive analysis)

How to Run/View the Project
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Place app.ipynb and owid-covid-data.csv in the same directory.
3. Open app.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to see data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

Insights or Reflection
• The project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning before analysis.
• Visualizations reveal trends and differences in COVID-19 impact across East African countries.
• Correlation analysis helps identify relationships between cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
• The workflow can be adapted for similar regional or global COVID-19 analyses.

Project Development
• Initial setup and data sourcing
• Data cleaning and preprocessing
• Exploratory data analysis and visualization
• Insights generation and reporting
